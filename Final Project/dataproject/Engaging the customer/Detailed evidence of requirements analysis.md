Gathering requirements for engaging the customers

An essential first step in doing data analysis to find trends and patterns is gathering the needs for involving the customers. It entails comprehending both the analytical restrictions and constraints as well as the demands and objectives of the target audience.

We can take the procedures mentioned below to acquire the requirements for involving customers in the examination of sales success on bike products:

Customers to identify: The first stage is to determine which clients are pertinent to the analysis. The Customers database, which holds details on the customers including their customer ID, first name, middle initial, and last name, can be used to accomplish this.
Define the analysis's scope: To make sure that the right information is gathered and processed, the analysis's scope should be precisely defined. In this instance, the analysis's focus is on bike products' sales, particularly mountain bikes and frames.
The next stage is to determine the data sources that will be used in the study. The Sales database and the Products database will serve as the main data sources in this scenario. Information regarding sales transactions, such as the sales ID, salesperson ID, customer ID, product ID, and quantity sold, is contained in the Sales database. The Products database contains details about the products, such as their name, price, and product ID.
Identify the analysis techniques: The analysis techniques should be chosen in accordance with the data needs and the analysis goals. In this situation, data mining, forecasting, and data modelling may be useful techniques for spotting patterns and trends in customer loyalty, product sales, and sales performance.
Define the outcome: The analysis's output should be described in terms of the precise insights and suggestions it is anticipated will be produced. The result in this scenario can contain data on bike product sales performance as well as suggestions for boosting revenue and patronage.
In general, thorough preparation and consideration of the data sources, data requirements, analysis objectives, and analysis methodologies are required to gather the requirements for involving the consumers in the analysis of sales performance on bike items. These techniques can be used to conduct an efficient analysis that offers insightful conclusions and suggestions for enhancing sales and client loyalty.
